Development Notes

Day 1:
-Attended platform meeting, where we discussed things at length.
--Meeting notes here: https://docs.google.com/a/pioneers.berkeley.edu/document/d/1ZzEE43NnQfrCQeyto2bFGne3P7qXl4kVtjKK6KOoZHY/edit
-Definately a window of opprotunity with the A level boards.  There's at least 2 (skin proc, dcbrushless driver, etc)
-Decided to do DCBrushless controller, since it's entry level with people i know who trust me.  POC: Duncan and Austin
- Recieved general directions from Duncan
-- 10 Amps, 7.2 Volts, DC Brushless motor contorller that communicates over serial.
-- recieved hardware: a AMS AS5134 Encoder.  THis encoder reqs a hovering 2-pole magnet to work, but it's pretty cool
-- Recieved hardware: a BOOSTXL-DRV8301-CB.  THis is a development board for the chips that we are going to base the final controller on.
-- Going to talk to austin about the controller. 

-- Still need a motor.

- INitial plan of attack: recive Hardware, make something breadboardish work.  Then test limits of that circuit & validate it.  Then go ahead and PCB it.
